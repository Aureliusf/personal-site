bo.tf is a url shortener that I made back in 2018 as a weekend project.

After looking for ready to ship projects I found [YOURLS](https://yourls.org) it is a light-weight open-source url shortener made in php and with a lot of customizability. It also has great features, such as link stats, automatic filtering or bulk creation of short links. But it has a big problems, it looks straight up from 2006.
Luckily it has plugins and after some diging I got to [Sleeky](https://sleeky.flynntes.com) theme, this looks wayy better.

With some extra diging in configs and some additions such as Google Analytics, I got up and runnign with [bo.tf](http://bo.tf)

Right now almost two years later still has dozens of users each month and I've been able to keep up with spam and other malicious intents.
